<h1>Styling &amp; Scripts</h1>
<p class="interactive">You are able to style your slides within a seperate css file and add as many script files as you wish, in order to make your slides <span class="interactive">interactive</span>. <br /><br /> Just place your scripts within a folder and give the name of that folder as option to your Slidevs.</p>
